3. **Downtown proximity matters**: Distance from downtown negatively impacts performance
4. **Sentiment analysis adds value**: Business description sentiment contributes to predictions

**Actionable Recommendations**:

- Target less competitive neighborhoods for new restaurants
- Consider proximity to downtown in location selection
- Optimize business descriptions for positive sentiment
- Use cluster analysis to identify restaurant archetypes
