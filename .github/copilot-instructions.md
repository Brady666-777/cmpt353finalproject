## VancouverPy: Restaurant Success Prediction Project

This is a data science project that predicts optimal locations for new restaurants in Vancouver, BC using machine learning and multiple data sources.

### Project Context

- Focus on geospatial analysis and machine learning for restaurant location prediction
- Integrates Vancouver Open Data, Yelp API, and Statistics Canada data
- Uses scikit-learn, xgboost, geopandas for modeling and analysis
- Target variable: Success Score based on Yelp ratings, reviews, and operational longevity

### Key Technologies

- Python 3.8+ with pandas, geopandas, scikit-learn, xgboost
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling
- API integration (Yelp Fusion, Vancouver Open Data)
- Geospatial data processing and visualization

### Development Guidelines

- Use environment variables for API keys (.env file)
- Follow data science best practices with clear separation of raw/processed data
- Implement robust error handling for API calls
- Document all feature engineering steps thoroughly
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
