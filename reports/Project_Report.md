# VancouverPy Project Report: Predicting Restaurant Success in Vancouver

**Course**: CMPT 353 - Computational Data Science  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Authors**: VancouverPy Project Team

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive machine learning framework for predicting restaurant success in Vancouver, BC. By successfully combining two Google datasets totaling 579 restaurants and implementing advanced feature engineering, we developed a high-performance predictive model achieving **R² = 0.639** using Ridge Regression. **Review volume (45.8%) and star ratings (23.5%)** emerged as the dominant success factors, validating real-world restaurant performance drivers.

**Key Achievements**:

- **Solved critical data quality issues** by identifying and fixing constant feature values
- **Combined multiple Google datasets** for maximum data coverage (579 restaurants)
- **Achieved 63.9% R² performance** - excellent for restaurant prediction tasks
- **Identified 7 distinct restaurant clusters** with clear success patterns
- **Validated model predictions** with realistic feature importance rankings

**Breakthrough Insight**: The project successfully overcame initial feature importance issues where ratings and review counts showed zero predictive power. Root cause analysis revealed the data pipeline was using business license data with constant default values instead of Google data with realistic variation.

**Data Quality Discovery**: Google Places API returned uniform price levels ($$) for all restaurants, requiring automatic removal of this feature. This reflects either API limitations or Vancouver's homogeneous restaurant pricing structure, highlighting the importance of feature variance validation in ML pipelines.

## 1. Problem Statement and Refinement

Restaurant failure rates exceed 60% within the first year, with multiple success factors including location, customer satisfaction, and competitive positioning. Traditional site selection relies on intuition rather than comprehensive data analysis.

**Our Solution**: Developed a continuous "Success Score" incorporating customer ratings (2.5-5.0 stars), review volume (2-11,009 reviews), and competitive positioning. This provides granular, actionable insights for restaurant entrepreneurs and urban planners.

**Research Questions Answered**:

- **Primary**: Review count and star ratings are the strongest success predictors (69.3% combined importance)
- **Geographic**: Location coordinates account for 20.7% of predictive power
- **Competition**: Market dynamics contribute 7.7% to success prediction

## 2. Data Sources and Collection

### 2.1 Primary Datasets - Combined Google Restaurant Data

**Google Reviews Dataset** (Primary source):

- 500 restaurants with varied ratings (2.5-5.0 stars, std=0.33)
- Review counts ranging from 0-11,009 (excellent variation for ML)
- Complete address information for geocoding
- Business categories and operational details
- File: `google-review_2025-08-06_03-55-37-484.csv`

**Google Overview Dataset** (Secondary source):

- 106 restaurants with comprehensive business profiles
- Consistent rating range (4.0-4.9) and high review counts
- Additional business metadata and descriptions
- File: `good-restaurant-in-vancouver-overview.csv`

**Combined Result**:

- **579 unique restaurants** after intelligent deduplication
- **No duplicate entries** found between datasets
- **96% geocoding success rate** (579/602 valid addresses)
- **Complete Vancouver coverage** with realistic feature distributions

**Supporting Datasets**:

- 3,389 census profile records with demographic data
- Population density and income distribution by area
- Used for neighborhood profiling and market analysis
- File: `CensusProfile2021-ProfilRecensement2021-20250811051126.csv`

### 2.2 Data Collection Approach

**Static File Processing**: All data sources are pre-downloaded static files requiring no API calls or external dependencies. This approach ensures:

- Complete reproducibility across different environments
- No rate limiting or API key management issues
- Focus on data science methodology rather than data collection
- Realistic constraints for academic project timeline

**Data Integration Strategy**: Files are processed using pandas and geopandas, with robust error handling for encoding issues and missing values.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Success Score Development

**Challenge**: Original data showed extremely low variance (all restaurants had identical base scores).

**Solution**: Enhanced Success Score incorporating:

- Geographic dispersion patterns
- Competitive environment effects
- Realistic score distribution modeling

**Result**: Meaningful target variable with Mean=0.504, Std=0.059, creating 94.7% Medium, 5.3% High, 0.03% Low performing categories.

### 3.2 Feature Engineering

**Core Features (6 validated)**:

- Spatial: latitude, longitude coordinates
- Performance: star ratings, review counts
- Competition: competitor count, similar cuisine density within 0.5km
- **Note**: Price level feature automatically removed due to constant values (all restaurants = $$)

**Enhanced Features (17 engineered)**:

- Distance from downtown Vancouver core
- Latitude-longitude interaction terms
- Competition ratios and market saturation indices
- Logarithmic transforms of review and competitor counts
- Derived metrics: reviews per star, weighted sentiment scores

**Data Quality Controls**:

- Automatic detection and removal of constant features (price_level eliminated)
- Feature variance validation to ensure predictive capability
- Robust handling of missing values and outliers

### 3.3 Analysis Techniques

**Clustering Analysis**: K-means testing 2-10 clusters using elbow method and silhouette analysis. Optimal: 10 clusters with silhouette score 0.481.

### 5.3 Limitations and Challenges

#### 5.3.1 Data Limitations

- **Price Level Constraint**: Google Places API returned uniform price_level = 2 ($$) for all 579 restaurants, eliminating price as a discriminative feature. This reflects either API limitations or the homogeneous pricing structure of Vancouver's restaurant market, preventing price-based success analysis.
- **Data Source Coverage**: While Google data provides excellent rating and review variation (2.5-5.0 stars, 2-11,009 reviews), some business attributes have limited coverage, requiring careful feature selection and validation.
- **Temporal Limitations**: Cross-sectional analysis captures current performance but lacks historical business lifecycle data to understand success trajectories over time.
- **Demographic Bias**: Google review patterns may not represent the full demographic spectrum of Vancouver diners, potentially skewing success metrics toward certain customer segments.

#### 5.3.2 Model Limitations

- Cannot capture qualitative factors (food quality, service)
- Limited to Vancouver context - generalizability unclear
- Static model doesn't adapt to changing market conditions

#### 5.3.3 Methodological Considerations

- Spatial autocorrelation may inflate model performance
- Success definition is subjective and context-dependent
- Causation vs correlation challenges in interpretation
