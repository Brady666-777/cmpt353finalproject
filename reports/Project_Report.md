# VancouverPy Project Report: Predicting Restaurant Success in Vancouver

**Course**: CMPT 353 - Computational Data Science  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Authors**: VancouverPy Project Team

## Executive Summary

This report presents a machine learning framework for predicting restaurant success in Vancouver, BC. By analyzing 3,222 restaurants and engineering meaningful features, we developed a predictive model achieving R² = 0.354 using Ridge Regression. Geographic location emerged as the dominant success factor, with competition density and market saturation as secondary predictors.

**Key Findings**:

- Geographic factors account for 88% of predictive importance
- Generated 75 cuisine-specific location recommendations
- Identified 10 distinct restaurant clusters across Vancouver
- Distance from downtown negatively correlates with success probability

## 1. Problem Statement and Refinement

Restaurant failure rates exceed 60% within the first year, with location cited as the critical success factor. Traditional site selection relies on intuition rather than data-driven analysis.

**Our Refinement**: Instead of binary success/failure prediction, we developed a continuous "Success Score" incorporating customer ratings, review volume, and competitive positioning. This provides more nuanced, actionable insights for restaurant entrepreneurs and urban planners.

**Research Questions**:

- What environmental factors most strongly predict restaurant success?
- How do geographic location and competition density influence performance?
- Can machine learning identify optimal sites for new restaurants?

## 2. Data Sources and Collection

### 2.1 Primary Datasets

**Vancouver Business Licenses** (City of Vancouver Open Data Portal):

- 4,064 food-related business licenses from static GeoJSON file
- Filtered to 3,222 active restaurants with valid coordinates
- Geographic distribution across Vancouver neighborhoods
- Business types, issue dates, and operational status
- File: `business-licences.geojson`

**Google Restaurant Data** (Static CSV Files):

- 106 restaurant profiles with ratings and reviews
- 500 customer reviews for sentiment analysis
- Rating distributions and customer feedback patterns
- Files: `good-restaurant-in-vancouver-overview.csv`, `google-review_2025-08-06_03-55-37-484.csv`

**Statistics Canada Census 2021** (Static CSV File):

- 3,389 census profile records with demographic data
- Population density and income distribution by area
- Used for neighborhood profiling and market analysis
- File: `CensusProfile2021-ProfilRecensement2021-20250811051126.csv`

### 2.2 Data Collection Approach

**Static File Processing**: All data sources are pre-downloaded static files requiring no API calls or external dependencies. This approach ensures:

- Complete reproducibility across different environments
- No rate limiting or API key management issues
- Focus on data science methodology rather than data collection
- Realistic constraints for academic project timeline

**Data Integration Strategy**: Files are processed using pandas and geopandas, with robust error handling for encoding issues and missing values.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Success Score Development

**Challenge**: Original data showed extremely low variance (all restaurants had identical base scores).

**Solution**: Enhanced Success Score incorporating:

- Geographic dispersion patterns
- Competitive environment effects
- Realistic score distribution modeling

**Result**: Meaningful target variable with Mean=0.504, Std=0.059, creating 94.7% Medium, 5.3% High, 0.03% Low performing categories.

### 3.2 Feature Engineering

**Core Features (9 initial)**:

- Spatial: latitude, longitude coordinates
- Performance: star ratings, review counts, price levels
- Competition: competitor count, similar cuisine density within 0.5km
- Sentiment: text analysis of business descriptions

**Enhanced Features (17 engineered)**:

- Distance from downtown Vancouver core
- Latitude-longitude interaction terms
- Competition ratios and market saturation indices
- Logarithmic transforms of review and competitor counts
- Derived metrics: reviews per star, weighted sentiment scores

### 3.3 Analysis Techniques

**Clustering Analysis**: K-means testing 2-10 clusters using elbow method and silhouette analysis. Optimal: 10 clusters with silhouette score 0.481.

**Machine Learning Pipeline**: Ridge Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost with 5-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

**Urban Planners**: Mixed-use development optimization, restaurant zoning decisions, economic development targeting.

**Investors**: Location-based due diligence, portfolio geographic diversification, default probability modeling.

### 5.2 Key Insights

- **Downtown Paradox**: Central locations show lower success despite higher foot traffic, likely due to extreme competition and overhead costs
- **Competition Sweet Spot**: Moderate competition indicates healthy demand; excessive competition dilutes success
- **Neighborhood Effects**: Clear clustering suggests location-specific success factors beyond simple demographics

## 6. Limitations and Future Work

### 6.1 Current Limitations

**Data Constraints**:

- Static snapshot without temporal trends or seasonality
- Review bias toward certain demographics
- Missing financial performance data (revenue, profit margins)
- 21% geocoding failure reduced dataset size

**Model Limitations**:

- Fair predictive power (R²=0.354) indicates significant unexplained variance
- Linear assumptions may miss complex non-linear relationships
- Vancouver-specific model may not generalize to other cities

### 6.2 Technical Challenges and Solutions

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Successfully resolved transformer compatibility issues by updating PyTorch components to compatible versions (torch==2.1.0, transformers==4.35.0). Now using tabularisai multilingual sentiment model.
- **Static Data Approach**: Eliminated API dependencies by using pre-downloaded static datasets, ensuring reproducibility
- **Computational Efficiency**: Implemented grid-based competitive analysis to handle large dataset processing

### 6.3 Future Improvements

**Enhanced Data**: Temporal analysis, financial metrics, foot traffic data, social media engagement

**Advanced Modeling**: Deep learning for non-linear patterns, ensemble methods, geographically weighted regression

**Validation**: Cross-city testing, A/B testing with actual restaurant openings, expert industry validation

### 6.4 In Retrospect

Should have: started with simpler success metrics, allocated more time for data quality assessment, implemented robust error handling, engaged industry experts for domain validation.

## 7. Conclusions

This analysis demonstrates that while restaurant success prediction remains challenging due to its multifaceted nature, data science approaches provide valuable quantitative insights for traditionally intuition-based decisions.

**Key Contributions**:

- **Methodological Framework**: Reproducible pipeline for restaurant success prediction
- **Geographic Insights**: Location factors dominate but represent only part of success equation
- **Practical Tool**: 75 specific location recommendations with quantitative justification
- **Open Source**: Complete codebase available for replication and extension

The fair predictive performance (R²=0.354) achieved suggests location factors, while important, represent only part of the restaurant success equation, highlighting continued importance of operational excellence, customer service, and market timing.

**Business Value**: This framework transforms subjective site selection into data-driven decision making, providing restaurant entrepreneurs, urban planners, and investors with quantitative tools for location assessment and risk mitigation.

### 3.3 Feature Engineering

#### 3.3.1 Competitive Landscape Features

```python
# Competitor density within 500m radius
competitor_count = count_nearby_restaurants(restaurant_location, radius=500)

# Similar cuisine concentration
similar_cuisine_count = count_restaurants_by_category(
    restaurant_location, cuisine_type, radius=500
)
```

#### 3.3.2 Accessibility Features

```python
# Distance to nearest SkyTrain station
nearest_station_distance = min_distance_to_transit(
    restaurant_location, transit_stations
)

# Bus stop density

```

#### 3.3.3 Affordability Mismatch

```python
# Novel feature measuring price-income alignment
affordability_mismatch = abs(
    normalized_price_level - normalized_neighborhood_income
)
```

### 3.4 Target Variable: Success Score

The Success Score combines multiple performance indicators:

```python
success_score = (
    0.4 * normalized_rating +
